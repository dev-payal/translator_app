REST API for Text Translation
This project is a simple translation API that uses Google Translate API to translate text from one language to another. It is built using Django and the googletrans package.

Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/translator-api.git
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
python -m venv translator
source translator/bin/activate

Install the required packages.
To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To start the server, run the following command:

python manage.py runserver
By default, the server will run at http://localhost:8000. You can then make requests to the API using the following endpoints:

POST /translate/
The POST /translate/ endpoint accepts a JSON payload with the following parameters:

text (required): The text to be translated.
source_lang (optional): The language of the text to be translated. If not specified, the API will attempt to detect the language automatically.
target_lang (required): The language to translate the text into.
Example Request:
json
{
    "text": "Hello, World!",
    "source_lang": "en",
    "target_lang": "fr"
}
Example Response:

json
{
    "translation": "Bonjour le monde!"
}

Testing
To run the test cases, run the following command:
python manage.py test myapp.tests

Caching
If the requested data is already translated once via the API, it will be cached or stored in a database. If a user requests already translated data, it will be served from the cache or database.
